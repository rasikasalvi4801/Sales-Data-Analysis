1. This dataset is based on 4 years of sales i.e. 2012,2013,2014,2015.
2. The total sales of 4 years have been around $12.64M and around 178K orders have been placed.
3. The highest sales were made in 2015 and the lowest in 2012 which shows a steady growth of the business.
4. The top 5 products by profit are Canon Copier, Cisco smartphone, Motorola smartphone, Hoover stove and Sauder Classic bookcase.
5. The top 5 products by loss are Bevis Computer table, Lexmark Printer Barrix conference table, Ibico Eletric binding system and Cubify printer.
6. Also we can see that Asia Pacific(31%) is the dominating market followed by Europe(27%) and Africa has the least sales(6%).
7. Also Consumer segment(50%) is huge followed by Corporate(30%).
8. from the regions also we can see that Asia has the highest sales followed by Europe.
9. Tom Ashbrook has been the customer which has contributed to most of the sales during the 4 years.
10. From the dataset we can conclude that phones and copiers were sold the most. But there are some products in these two categories which are also loss-making to the business. Mostly the loss-making ones are from the tables and printers subcategory.
12. Saturday was the day when most orders were placed followed by Wednesday and Tuesday.
13. This can change as and when the filters are applied over the years. For eg in 2012 the top customer was sean miller.

## Recommendations:
1. The USCA market has decreased in sales over the last 4 years. The reason can be analysed as in if the operations were affected or if was there any other reason.
2. The African market stands steady at 6% all over the 4 years. The business can look for opportunities for increasing sales over there.
3. $27 as an avg shipping cost is on the higher side if the business is shipping products in the same region. That can be lowered on the basis of shipping costs in that particular region.
4. The products giving loss to the company maybe by stocking up or returns should be analysed. The products can be discontinued or put up on sale for clearing up the stock.
5. The top customers can be awarded with some discounts or gift cards.
6. Saturday is the day when the highest orders were placed. With this information, the business can decisions regarding discounts and weekly sales over the weekends which can increase revenue.
7. The data can be further analysed using the time intelligence functions such as Year over year % growth or the profit at the same period last year.
